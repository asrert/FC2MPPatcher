- Automatically search for install directory.
	- Find steam installpath, and thereby find game installdir (WIP)
		- And possibly linux support?
		See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34090258/find-steam-games-folder
- Auto rescan for installdir if invalid directory is set?
- Should we return first installdir found or give the user abilibty to select installation to path?

- Build MPPatch.dll and static link libwinpthread.dll instead of dynamic linking.
- Workaround for Windows:
	Download: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MinGW/Base/libiconv/libiconv-1.14-3/libiconv-1.14-3-mingw32-dev.tar.lzma/download
	Copy mingw32/lib/ and mingw32/include/ from file to C:\Qt\Tools\mingw730_32\i686-w64-mingw32
	Download: libiconv-1.14-3-mingw32-bin.tar.lzma from same place.
	Copy bin/ from file to C:\Qt\Tools\mingw730_32\
