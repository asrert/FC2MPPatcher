Custom Map:
	Problem is that client and server wrong IP address is annonces thru Ubisoft's backed, 
        which results in clients trying to download maps from servers RFC1918 address over the Internet.
	
	Maybe this is public IP detection stuff gone horribly wrong?

Community Map Server:
	The community map server seems to work if user login with their actual Ubi.com account, 
	one important thing to notice is that Far Cry 2 cannot handle password exceeding 12 characters.
        
        So when using a password with less characters than that, you can access the community map server.
	
	Since the community map server communicates over HTTP, the library winhttp.dll is used.
        Users report that stock winhttp.dll's from Windows 7 and Windows 10 do not work when eiher downloading or uploading maps, so we need to look into why that is.
	Simply putting a old winhttp.dll file in Far Cry 2's bin folder is a dirty fix, problably just a function call that as changed.

	I can report that everything is working out-of-the-box under WINE without altering any dll overrides.
